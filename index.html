  <h1>What I've learnt so far about coding</h1>
   <p>Once upon the time, there was a lazy norm who was going to sleep well until her brother called her so surprisingly that the norm had to learn about coding right then.</p>
   <p>Here is a place for that norm to practice coding. Let's take a look at what she has learnt so far!</p>
  <h2>Night 1</h2>
   <p>Hi, I'm the lazy norm. I entered the very first stage of learning HTMl last night (Jul 10th, 2021) and now I'm practicing what I was taught last night, which means I'm coding for the first time of my entire life :)</p>
   <p>Ok, I'm typing a random reference below:</p>
  <h3>Random reference on Art</h3>
   <p>The Blue Period (Spanish: Per√≠odo Azul) is a term used to define the works produced by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso between 1901 and 1904 when he painted essentially monochromatic paintings in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colors. These somber works, inspired by Spain and painted in Barcelona and Paris, are now some of his most popular works, although he had difficulty selling them at the time.</p>
